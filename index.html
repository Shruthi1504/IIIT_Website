            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My Name is Shruthi Bathini. I was born on the 15th of April in the year of NASA's stardust mission (2006). I have a weird liking to learning obscure facts so that I can bring up ransom tidbits of infromation at random intervals. I am currently pursuing my 
                B.Tech in CSE from IIIT-Hyderabad. I think I have a hobby of getting hobbies. I have done everything from sports to artistic activities. My top hobbies however are swimming, gymnastics and bead colouring (don't knock it till you try it).
                I spent my entire life in a tiny island country called Bahrain, in the gulf. Its small enough that you cannot see it on a world map, but it is the place that I call home. This is all about me. Hopefully, I make a good first impression.
